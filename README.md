## Netlify CMS
Looking to set up a blog? Look no further! This template gives you a simple and elegant Preact-powered blog that you can edit using [Netlify CMS] (https://www.netlifycms.org/) .

### To get started with any of these templates, run preact create to create a new project with your template of choice:
```javascript
preact create <template-name> <app-name>
```
Now that your project is set up, you can cd into the newly-created directory and start a development server:
```javascript
cd <app-name>
npm start
```
Now open your editor and start editing! For most templates, the best place to start is src/index.js or src/components/app/index.js.

## Material
This template comes pre-configured with [preact-material-components] (https://material.preactjs.com/) and a small example app to get you started quickly and easily.

### To get started with any of these templates, run preact create to create a new project with your template of choice:
```javascript
preact create <template-name> <app-name>
```
Now that your project is set up, you can cd into the newly-created directory and start a development server:
```javascript
cd <app-name>
npm start
```
Now open your editor and start editing! For most templates, the best place to start is src/index.js or src/components/app/index.js.

## Simple
A "bare-bones" template, starting from a "Hello World" application. If you're looking to choose your own tools or already have a setup in mind, this is a good way to start.

### To get started with any of these templates, run preact create to create a new project with your template of choice:
```javascript
preact create <template-name> <app-name>
```
Now that your project is set up, you can cd into the newly-created directory and start a development server:
```javascript
cd <app-name>
npm start
```
Now open your editor and start editing! For most templates, the best place to start is src/index.js or src/components/app/index.js.
